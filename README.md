# Dialouge System
On here I created a small Dialouge system for use in Unity Engine, With it you can give a specific parameter called < speed > in the source text file. You can set through the npc wether it can speak with the normal language or bippy boppy as I like to call it :)

## Features
- [Actual letter drawing & sounds](https://github.com/SjorsMaster/TextBox/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/text/textDisplay.cs)
- [Line manager](https://github.com/SjorsMaster/TextBox/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/text/rpgText.cs)
- [NPC](https://github.com/SjorsMaster/TextBox/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/npc/npc.cs)

## Software Anaylse 
I chose Unity Engine because I am most experienced with this software, and was wondering what I still could learn from it.

It seems like there are still quite a few things I had to get a better grip on, which I do now.

For example, Delegates.

Seems like the version of Unity I chose kept crashing a lot, Learned not to update :)

## What did I want to achieve
- A lively, stable text box.
- Lively NPC's (Head looking, voices).
- Day/Night cycle.
